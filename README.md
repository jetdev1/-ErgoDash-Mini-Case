# -ErgoDash-Mini-Case
This a sandwich-mount case and plate I designed for a handwired ErgoDash Mini. Some notes about the files:

1. Only use the KMK config files as reference. They're pretty messy as I had to compensate for some errors I made while handwiring.
2. The M3 screw holes are a little tight, so it might take a bit of effort to get in. I used an electric screwdriver, screwed it in all the way and then used reverse mode while pushing it out but... it's easier to just widen the hole.
3. The holes were designed for 3mm x 4.5mm (h x d) heat-set inserts
4. The plate is designed for female header pins 8.5mm tall.
5. The case was designed for use with the Pi Pico.
5. The TRRS cutout is a little narrow and not all cables will fit. Check the diameter of your TRRS cable termination first.
6. The mounting holes above the Pi Pico were originally designed for screwing in either an acrylic cover or a module with an OLED screen, but it is too thin and I don't expect it to hold up well. There isn't much clearance underneat it for an M2 nut either.
